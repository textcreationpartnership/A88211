1. The LAWES Funerall. OR, An Epiſtle written by Lieutenant Col.
JOHN LILBURN, Priſoner in the Tower of London, unto a friend of his,
giving him a large relation of his defence, made before the Judges of the
Kings Bench, the 8. of May 1648. againſt both the illegall
commitments of him by the Houſe of Lords, and the Houſe of Commons, and how
that the Judges in open Court, were neceſſitated to confeſſe, there is
by neither of the commitments any crime in Law laid unto his Charge, yet though
he was impriſoned for nothing, being committed by a ſuperiour Court the
Lords, and that upon a Sentence, they could not releaſe him, but remanded him
back again Priſoner unto the Tower, which is a full Declaration, there is no
Law left in England now, but that the people thereof muſt be
governed by the luſt, will and pleaſure of the Houſe of Lords, &c.
and though they deale never ſo unjuſtly with them, to the cauſeleſſe
deſtruction of their Lives, Eſtates, and Families, yet the Judges of
England (being in deed and in truth meere Ciphers) cannot remedy it,
becauſe it is done by their ſuperiours, the Houſe of Lords; wherefore the
ſaid Iohn Lilburne doth declare his ſorrowfulneſſe in his
great miſtake, in zealouſly ſtirring up the people of England to
ſtand up to maintain their Lawes, ſeeing they have none in being, but the
will of the Lords, and therefore according to his promiſe, to the Judges in
open Court; he provokes all the Commons of England out of all the
Counties thereof, to haſten up to Weſtminſter to the Lords
houſe, and there ſuffer the Lords (who now have conquered and ſubdued all
their Lawes) to bore them through their eares as their vaſſalls and
ſlaves, if they can beare it with patience.
